    <!--Steps-->
    <h1>Cooking Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Pork</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Trim excess fat (optional). </b>If using pork loin, you can leave a thin layer of fat for extra flavor or trim it off for a cleaner bite.</li>
        <li><b>Pound the meat (if needed). </b>If your pork is thick (over ¾ inch), lightly pound it with a meat mallet or rolling pin to an even thickness. This helps it cook evenly.</li>
        <li><b>Season both sides with salt and pepper. </b>Don&#39;t overdo it—just enough to enhance the natural flavors.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 2: Bread the Cutlet</h2>
    <p>Tonkatsu follows a three-step breading process, which is key to achieving a crisp, airy crust.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Dredge the pork in flour. </b>Lightly coat the entire surface. Shake off excess.</li>
        <li><b>Dip it in beaten egg. </b>Ensure even coverage—this helps the breadcrumbs adhere.</li>
        <li><b>Press into panko breadcrumbs. </b>Use your hands to gently press the breadcrumbs in, ensuring a solid, even layer. Don&#39;t overpack—too much pressure can make the coating dense rather than crisp.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 3: Fry to Perfection</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Heat the oil to 340&ndash;350°F (170&ndash;175°C) </b>in a deep pan or heavy-bottomed skillet. The oil should be deep enough to submerge at least half of the cutlet.</li>
        <li><b>Test the oil </b>by dropping in a few panko crumbs. If they sizzle and rise immediately, it's ready.</li>
        <li><b>Fry the pork in batches. </b>Carefully lower the cutlet into the oil. Cook for <b>3&ndash;4 minutes per side,</b> flipping once, until deeply golden brown.</li>
        <li><b>Drain and rest. </b>Transfer to a wire rack or paper towels. Letting it sit for 2&ndash;3 minutes helps the crust set.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 4: Slice and Serve</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Slice the tonkatsu </b>into even strips, about ¾ inch wide. A sharp knife is crucial here—pressing too hard will crush the crust.</li>
        <li><b>Drizzle with tonkatsu sauce </b>or serve it on the side for dipping.</li>
        <li><b>Pair with shredded cabbage </b>(a classic accompaniment that balances the richness) or opt for rice and curry.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Optional: Make Japanese Curry with Rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <p>If you want a heartier meal, adding Japanese curry transforms tonkatsu into katsu curry, a staple dish in Japan.</p>
        <li><b>Cook the rice</b> according to package instructions. Short-grain Japanese rice is best.</li>
        <li><b>Sauté onions, carrots, and potatoes </b>in a pan with a little oil.</li>
        <li><b>Add water or broth </b>and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li><b>Stir in Japanese curry roux. </b>Let it dissolve and thicken.</li>
        <li><b>Serve with the tonkatsu. </b>Place a portion of rice on a plate, ladle the curry next to it, and lay the crispy pork cutlet on top.</li>
    </ol>
